# todo-list


## What?
A simple todo list application that does the following:
- Add new todo tasks.
- Remove todo tasks.
- Mark todo tasks as checked.

The application is expected to be accessible to deal with the largest amount of users, responsive to deal with the largest amount of devices.

## Why?
Because we can.

## How?
Teamwork. Progress was accelerating starting from 0 in the functinos, since we had no idea about the pre-made code, the functionality of it was ambiguous for the entire process of going through logic.js. But eventually.. Whorray!

## Plan
Mohammad and Marwa had created the addTodo, deleteTodo functions while I -Noureldean- worked on the markTodo function. On the next day Marwa had worked on the CSS while Mohammad and I had completed working on the remaining of the functions and the DOM.js, each had worked his share on the TDD.
